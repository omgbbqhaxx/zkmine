## ZKmine
Welcome to the zk-mine;

In this example, our program retrieves the user's Ethereum address and checks the difficulty modulus. If the difficulty is set to 2, this means 1 out of every 2 addresses can receive a reward, airdrop, or any other incentive you choose to provide.

If you'd like the airdrop to target 1 out of every 10 users, simply adjust the difficulty to 10.

# Quick Ardrops

You can share quick airdrops with your community people check 
their airdrops from your website or program if they are lucky can claim their airdrops.

# Random number generator.

This secret ZK Codes generating random number from address and nobody know how this formula works with this method you can create luck based games and all other things.

# Synthetic sport games.

Using this Random Number generator model you can create synthetic sport and in this game synthetic winners derivated from your wallets.


# Nonce problem

In this example 1 wallet can generate only 1 Random number but we will find to way add nonce and 1 wallet can generate more than 1 sign.

# Where zkmine name comes from.

if you incrase difficulity people can write a miner programs and can try many different wallets for get rewards. thats mean people can make wallet mining for mint / get rewards from contract.
